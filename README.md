This is the code for the Django Tutorial:

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/intro/tutorial01/

I have added some notes on the tutorial.   The localhost website does not produce a usable website
when the server is run.   You need to test the site using links similar to the following:

  - http://localhost:8000/polls/
  - http://localhost:8000/admin/
  - http://localhost:8000/polls/1/
  - http://localhost:8000/polls/1/results/
  - http://localhost:8000/polls/1/vote/
  - http://localhost:8000/polls/5/                # Should produce an error.

I have not completed the advanced tutorial, which is about packaging the Django app.
